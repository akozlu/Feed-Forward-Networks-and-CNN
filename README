This project includes implementation of both Feed-forward Neural Network and ConvolutionalNeural Network(CNN) on the CIFAR-10 image dataset. I use Pytorch as the deep learning framework.

Feed Forward Neural Network: 
A simple one-hidden  layer  neural  network. Input image is a 3072x1 vector. The hidden layer has 1024 neurons followed by sigmoid activation function. The last layer outputs 10 probabilities for each class.
To run the network uncomment train_and_test_ff_network(). 
The function plots training accuracy over each epoch and prints out the test accuracy. 

Convolutional Neural Network:

\b train_and_test_convolutional_network() 
\b0 This function plots training accuracy over each epoch and prints out the test accuracy. Note that the final version uses normalised images. You can uncomment this under Dataset initialisation function. \
Also note that I gave my dataset class an extra argument called custom. If custom is false, it only normalises the picture. If it is true, it turns the image into grayscale and then normalises it. If you want to train network on grayscale normalized images, make sure custom is True. Also change input channel of self.conv1 to 1 and make sure to change \

Experiment 4: \
These values are not in the script. If you run the script you will get the results I got for experiment 3. The hyper parameters I give in Part 4 need to be coded again. \
\
CUSTOM-CNN: \
If you uncomment the following line, you will run another CNN architecture to train normalised coloured images. It has an extra convolutional layer and different parameters. This is what I used to experiment with a variety of CNN architectures. Initially this was designed to train grayscale images, but I used it for coloured images to show that it was able to reach the same training and testing accuracy with the CNN given in the homework.\
